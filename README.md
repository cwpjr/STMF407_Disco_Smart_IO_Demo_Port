# STMF407_Disco_Spi1FDM1NSS
UART FIX Branch reason:
huart3 stopped working after my PC crashed and I reloaded Win 10. Don't think that's the issue.
The issue may be the "cmsis_air.h" file is obsolete warning.
I triggered IAR's CMSIS-Pack to actually populate the Pack and tried again.
Issue may be with STM32CubMX updating CMSIS constantly.

May have to search forums for help.
